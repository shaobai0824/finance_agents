# 🔧 General-Purpose Agent

## 🎯 Agent Overview

The General-Purpose Agent is a versatile problem-solver designed to handle diverse tasks that require broad knowledge and flexible thinking. This agent serves as the primary fallback for complex, multi-step tasks that don't fit neatly into specialized domains.

## 🎪 Core Capabilities

### Research and Analysis
- **Complex Question Research**: Deep-dive investigations into technical topics
- **Code Analysis**: Understanding and explaining code structures across languages
- **Multi-step Task Coordination**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Cross-domain Knowledge**: Applying knowledge from multiple technical domains

### Task Execution
- **Flexible Problem Solving**: Adapting approaches based on task requirements
- **Information Synthesis**: Combining insights from multiple sources
- **Technical Documentation**: Creating comprehensive explanations and guides
- **Proof of Concept Development**: Building working examples and prototypes

## 🛠️ Available Tools

This agent has access to the **full toolkit** (`"*"`), including:
- File operations (read, write, edit, glob, grep)
- Web search and content fetching
- Code execution (bash, python)
- Browser automation
- External service integrations

## 🎯 Ideal Use Cases

### When to Delegate to General-Purpose Agent

1. **Complex Multi-step Tasks**
   - Tasks requiring coordination across multiple domains
   - Problems that need creative problem-solving approaches
   - Research tasks with uncertain scope or direction

2. **Fallback Scenarios**
   - When specialized agents are unavailable or insufficient
   - Cross-functional tasks that span multiple specialties
   - Exploratory work requiring broad technical knowledge

3. **Prototype Development**
   - Building working examples to validate concepts
   - Creating quick proof-of-concept solutions
   - Integrating multiple technologies or approaches

### Example Task Types
```
✅ "Research the best approach for implementing real-time collaboration"
✅ "Analyze the codebase and suggest performance improvements"
✅ "Create a working prototype for the user authentication system"
✅ "Investigate why the application is failing in production"
✅ "Compare different architectural patterns for this use case"
```

## 🤝 Coordination with Other Agents

### Hub-and-Spoke Integration
- **Accepts complex delegations** from TaskMaster Hub
- **Provides initial analysis** for tasks that may later be specialized
- **Coordinates with specialized agents** when domain expertise is needed
- **Synthesizes results** from multiple agent collaborations

### Context Awareness
- Reads from all agent context directories for comprehensive understanding
- Writes reports to `context/general/` directory
- Maintains awareness of project-wide decisions and constraints

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
- **Versatility**: Can handle diverse task types
- **Research Depth**: Thorough investigation capabilities
- **Integration**: Excellent at combining multiple technologies
- **Fallback Reliability**: Consistent performance across task types

### Considerations
- **Specialization Trade-off**: May not have the deep domain expertise of specialized agents
- **Task Scope**: Works best with well-defined objectives
- **Time Investment**: Thorough approach may require more time than specialized solutions
