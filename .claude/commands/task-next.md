      → TaskMaster will provide support tools

  [4] ⏭️ Skip this task for now
      → Move to next priority task
      → Mark current task for later review

  [5] 📝 Modify task requirements
      → Edit task description or scope
      → Hub will re-analyze with new parameters

  [6] ⏸️ Pause TaskMaster execution
      → Stop automated suggestions
      → Switch to full manual control

🛡️ Emergency Controls:
