# 🚀 Deployment and Operations Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

This template provides comprehensive guidelines for deployment processes, infrastructure management, and operational procedures to ensure reliable and scalable production deployments.

## 🏗️ Deployment Architecture

### Environment Strategy
```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓          ↓
   Feature    Integration  Live
   Testing     Testing    System
```

### Infrastructure Components
- **Load Balancers**: Traffic distribution and failover
- **Application Servers**: Core application hosting
- **Database Cluster**: Data persistence and replication
- **Cache Layer**: Performance optimization
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and alerting

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. **Build Stage**
```yaml
build:
  steps:
    - checkout: code
    - install: dependencies
    - compile: application
    - run: unit tests
    - create: artifacts
```

#### 2. **Test Stage**
```yaml
test:
  steps:
    - deploy: to staging
    - run: integration tests
    - run: e2e tests
    - run: performance tests
    - run: security scans
```

#### 3. **Deploy Stage**
```yaml
deploy:
  strategy: blue-green
  steps:
    - prepare: new environment
    - deploy: application
    - run: smoke tests
    - switch: traffic
    - cleanup: old environment
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Security scans completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Database migrations prepared (if needed)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Team notification sent

### During Deployment
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress
- [ ] Verify health checks
- [ ] Check application logs
- [ ] Validate key functionality
- [ ] Monitor system metrics
- [ ] Confirm database connectivity

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Smoke tests executed successfully
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] User acceptance testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment post-mortem (if issues occurred)

## 🔧 Deployment Strategies

### 1. **Blue-Green Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to green environment
kubectl apply -f green-deployment.yaml

# Switch traffic to green
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Scale down blue environment
kubectl scale deployment blue-app --replicas=0
```

### 2. **Rolling Deployment**
```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

### 3. **Canary Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy canary version (10% traffic)
kubectl apply -f canary-deployment.yaml

# Monitor metrics for 30 minutes
# If successful, gradually increase traffic
# If issues detected, rollback immediately
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Application Metrics
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile < 500ms
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1%
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage

#### Infrastructure Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: < 80%
- **Memory Usage**: < 85%
- **Disk Usage**: < 90%
- **Network I/O**: Bandwidth utilization

#### Business Metrics
- **User Sessions**: Active user count
- **Conversion Rate**: Business KPIs
- **Revenue**: Financial impact

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: HighErrorRate
    condition: error_rate > 0.01
    severity: critical
    actions:
      - page: on-call-engineer
      - slack: dev-team-channel

  - name: HighResponseTime
    condition: response_time_p95 > 1000
    severity: warning
    actions:
      - slack: dev-team-channel
```

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- Response time degrades significantly
- Health checks fail
- Critical monitoring alerts fire

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# 1. Identify the last known good version
kubectl rollout history deployment/app

# 2. Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app

# 3. Verify rollback success
kubectl rollout status deployment/app

# 4. Monitor application health
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp
```

## 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform Example
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = var.app_ami
  instance_type = "t3.medium"

  tags = {
    Name = "app-server-${var.environment}"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

### Kubernetes Manifests
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Use secure image registries
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement network segmentation
- [ ] Use least-privilege access
- [ ] Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Secrets Management
```bash
# Using Kubernetes secrets
kubectl create secret generic app-secrets \
  --from-literal=db-password=secret123 \
  --from-literal=api-key=abc123
```
