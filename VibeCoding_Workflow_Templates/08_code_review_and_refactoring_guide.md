# 📝 Code Review and Refactoring Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

This template provides comprehensive guidelines for code review processes and systematic refactoring approaches, ensuring code quality and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle.

## 🔍 Code Review Process

### Pre-Review Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows established style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Self-review completed

### Review Focus Areas

#### 1. **Code Quality**
- **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
- **Maintainability**: Can it be easily modified?
- **Consistency**: Does it follow project conventions?
- **Complexity**: Are complex parts well-documented?

#### 2. **Architecture & Design**
- **SOLID Principles**: Are they followed?
- **Design Patterns**: Are appropriate patterns used?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Are responsibilities well-divided?
- **API Design**: Are interfaces clean and intuitive?

#### 3. **Performance & Security**
- **Performance**: Are there obvious bottlenecks?
- **Security**: Are security best practices followed?
- **Resource Usage**: Is memory/CPU usage reasonable?
- **Error Handling**: Are edge cases covered?

## 🔄 Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Refactor
- Code smells are detected
- Performance issues arise
- Adding new features becomes difficult
- Technical debt accumulates

### Refactoring Strategies

#### 1. **Extract Method**
```javascript
// Before
function processOrder(order) {
    // validate order
    if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
        throw new Error('No items');
    }
    // calculate total
    let total = 0;
    for (const item of order.items) {
        total += item.price * item.quantity;
    }
    // apply discounts
    if (order.discountCode) {
        total *= 0.9;
    }
    return total;
}

// After
function processOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    const total = calculateTotal(order.items);
    return applyDiscounts(total, order.discountCode);
}
```

#### 2. **Extract Variable**
```javascript
// Before
if ((platform.toUpperCase().indexOf("MAC") > -1) &&
    (browser.toUpperCase().indexOf("IE") > -1) &&
    wasInitialized() && resize > 0) {
    // do something
}

// After
const isMacOs = platform.toUpperCase().indexOf("MAC") > -1;
const isIE = browser.toUpperCase().indexOf("IE") > -1;
const isInitialized = wasInitialized();
const shouldResize = resize > 0;

if (isMacOs && isIE && isInitialized && shouldResize) {
    // do something
}
```
